## Classical Guitar Is Hard

When first approaching classical guitar, I did not know how tremendously
difficult this instrument is. On any instrument in any genre, there is high bar
for excellence that people only achieve by spending hours a day for many years.
What makes classical guitar "hard" is how how much effort is required up front
to get even seemingly simple pieces of music sounding passable.

I have seen numerous forum posts inquiring whether classical guitar is harder
than other forms of guitar, but I feel like a fair amount of the discussion I
saw didn't seem to get to the heart of my experience.

If you're exploring music and interested in whether you should approach
classical guitar, see the [last section](#should-i-try-classical-guitar) below. 

### Disclaimer

This is in no way to claim classical guitar is "more real," "superior," or "the
right discipline;" it is simply to capture my experience. In fact, if you are a
new musician who is only interested in playing Western classical music, I would
encourage you to play music from other genres and with other musicians to round
out your overall musicianship. 

### Guitar Across Genres: My Own First Days In Classical Versus Folk

In my own musical journey, I've had cursory exposure to folk music with
friends. I will use this as a case study to explain why classical guitar is
"hard." The punchline: while you can make folk music as difficult as classical
music, folk music also has earlier milestones that are easy to hit and can lead
to a lot more participation early on. The same arguments can be made across
other genres like rock and pop.

#### Summary

In folk (and many genres), guitar is often used as an accompanying instrument
to provide harmony and/or rhythm for voice or other instruments.

My lovely and amazing friends who play folk music on a regular basis graciously
allow me to join them. When playing music with them, I have found that the
minimum that is expected of me in this context is to:

* Strum in a rhythmic pattern
* Through a chord progression
* To support vocals

This is in contrast to classical guitar, where one is expected to:
* Play simple chords, arpeggios, and/or melodies 
* Play longer passages that are more complex and therefore repeated less often
* Perform as a solo instrumentalist

As a reminder, folk music can be just as difficult as classical music in all of
these arenas. The only difference is that classical guitar doesn't have the 
equivalent *earliest* milestones of folk.

#### Strumming Can Be More Forgiving Than Plucking 

Possibly the greatest difference between early classical versus folk guitar is
that you start by strumming instead of plucking. Left-hand chord changes for
chord progressions are obviously difficult for beginners; however, plucking
strings is *surprisingly* unforgiving.

When strumming a chord, if some strings are muted, the chord is not necessarily
lost. For example, the typical open C chord contains the notes C3, E3, G3, C4,
and E4. If C4 or E4 are missing, it may not really matter in context. This
is obviously not true if the notes you're missing change the harmony
significantly (i.e., missing the only minor third in a chord).

When playing a melody or arpeggio pattern, missing notes stand out like a sore
thumb. Touching a string with either hand after you've played it will instantly
mute it. This not only goes for accidentally bumping strings, but also 
preparation - touching a string with either hand before you need to will cause
other notes to disappear. 

Folk music can obviously have plucked pieces; the only difference is that 
classical guitar has virtually no entirely strummed pieces.

#### Accompaniment can be more repetitive than solo performance.

When strumming beginner chord patterns in folk music, you can work your way
through a few common chord progressions, and be able to accompany folks to
a number of songs. If you need to change keys upward, you can do so
with a capo. This is a particularly rewarding aspect of learning folk music, 
and can fuel beginners to keep learning, playing with friends, and exploring.

One of my favorite folk songs that I quite enjoy has the following simple
repeated chord pattern: D D G D / G G A D. It does not change throughout the
song. It's great fun and a crowd favorite, and I'm always excited to play it.

Beginning repertoire for classical guitar is made of short, simple pieces with
simple harmonic ideas, but the pieces you learn are often chosen to expose you
to as many *different* things in playing as possible, and therefore the skills
learned in one piece are insufficient to play the next.

For example, the three most recent beginner pieces I have learned each have a
specific lesson: 
1. Specific types of left-hand chord transitions
1. Staccatto versus legato articulation and damping (intentionally muting). 
1. Layering three distinct voices together to form a cohesive whole. 

Playing any one of these pieces well does not give you the skills to play the
others well - these are a part of a huge array of building blocks that you
slowly accumulate over time, which help you unlock more advanced repertoire
later. 

As a reminder, folk music can certainly demand all of these things. It's just
that classical guitar does not consider these early strumming patterns a useful
milestone.

#### Accompaniment - Eyes Aren't On You

Naturally, when strumming chords for accompaniment, you want to sound great.
However, in the earliest days of folk, if you're a bit mediocre (but of course
not terrible), the eyes of the audience aren't on you - you're really there to
help illuminate someone else. This makes participating with friends fun even 
when you don't sound great.

Early pieces in classical guitar are often solo. Any mistakes you make are in
in the spotlight. Moreover, since entertaining the audience is your job and
your job alone, we revisit the notion of reptition: if someone were to strum
three chords for three minutes with no vocals, the audience would be painfully
bored and dread whatever they were about to hear next. You instead need to walk
through a number of different musical ideas to keep the audience engaged and
excited to hear what is coming next.

As a reminder, there is plenty of solo or lead instrumental folk music. It is
simply that classical guitar doesn't have such simple, early accompaniment
milestones.

### What Makes Guitar Unique

Above we compared guitar in two contexts, but now I'd like to explore some 
aspects of playing guitar people might not fully consider. I don't really play
other instruments, so this is more things that I learned and comparisons I 
imagine with the tiniest bit of experience singing, pushing keys at a piano, 
and having friends who play winds.

#### Tone Production

Tone production on guitar is not wildly difficult, but isn't free. The
instrument does have frets which alleviate the need for intonation, but
producing a rich, full sound with the right hand takes work. Players who play
with nails will need to learn to file their nails into distinct shapes polish
them with sandpaper. It's a process of experimentation and improvement.
Improper playing with nails can also can cause loud rubbing, clicking, or
scratching sounds.

Moreover, as called out earlier, plucking is surprisingly unforgiving.
Vibrating strings can be interrupted by by either the left hand or the right
hand being out of place or preparing notes too soon. With six strings to manage
as compared to bowed string instruments, moving your fingers over the strings
while you play can be treacherous.

#### Left Hand Gymnastics 

You might think that frets make this instrument easy, but the result is that
they allow you to perform incredible feats of strength and dexterity with
your left hand, and music will demand that you do. Fairly early pieces require
stretching your fingers *quite* far, and positioning them in extremely precise
ways to not disturb strings they should not be touching. 

Sounding combinations and sequences of notes can come with wildly different
fingerings depending on context. Notes appear in multiple placees, and the
fingers used to play them (even if they're in one spot) constantly change. My
teacher with over fifty years' experience has remarked on multiple occasions
that the difficulty of playing music on guitar is front-loaded in this way -
you're moving your hands through new and interesting positions constantly. 

#### Six Strings That Can Overring

Fairly early on in guitar music, guitarists are expected to be able to run
multiple voices of music in what they are playing - even just a simple bass
line to accompany a melody. Keeping track of these different voices and keeping
them sounding well alongside each other takes work. There are fewer
complexities to manage than on that of harp, piano, or organ, but even playing
more than one voice still adds a dimension of playing when compared to
instruments that sound only one note at a time. As far as I can tell, this
complexity is in exchange for control and sustain across individual notes
played on other instruments.

#### Timbre

Classical guitar has a surprisingly wide range of timbre depending on where and
how strings are plucked. This is someting that takes practice, but even fairly
new players can use this to add another dimension to their playing.

## Should I try classical guitar? 

If you want to play classical guitar, then of course you should!  If you don't
know, read below to help find out.

### When It Is For You

My experience with guitar practice has been as follows. The nature of learning
classical music me seems to involve meditative, mindful practice sessions, and
the more I add discipline to my approach, the faster I get results. Noodling or
mindlessly going through passages I enjoy seems to get me to the end of my
practice time without much improvement. Milestones sometimes seem very far
apart, but are always very rewarding. I find it hard to approach this
instrument casually; it clearly requires dedication.

If that sounds like an exciting journey to you, then get to it!

####  A Note On Nails

Classical guitarists did not have nails forever. Brandon Acker has a video on
playing without nails [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjNFvtRU4Jc).

If you want a nail-like timbre but can't have nails for practical reasons, you
can fashion wire fingerpicks to replace nails -- see
[butterflyfingerpicks.com](https://www.butterflyfingerpicks.com/) for
instructions. I have not tried this myself, but have seen at least one video
testimonial.

### When It's Not For You

If you are an adult learner looking to explore music more casually, don't know
if you a lot of time to dedicate to practice sessions, or want earlier ways to
participate in music with your friends, I would invite you to look at other
genres of music. 

Genres like rock, folk, and pop might have more rewarding early milestones, 
and you might be able to participate more with family and friends early on.
The experience may be rewarding with fewer techincal skills, and you can 
always expand your technical skills later. 

If you are undecided now, classical guitar will still be there for you later.

### Side Note: Lack of Intonation Is A Trap 

Early on, I did not build my ear in music because I did not have to intonate.
For folks learning instruments where they do not really have to intonate, I
highly recommend learning basic singing of scales to build a connection to
yourself and pitches independent of your instrument. You should be using your
mind to imagine the music, and your instrument to conjure it, rather than
imagining your muscle memory on the instrument, and guessing whether it's right
after you produce the sound.
